Disclaimers
===========

* As described in the license, the developers cannot be held
  responsible for incorrect results arising from the code (whether due
  to a mistake on the part of the users, or due to a bug in the code
  or a mistake in the documentation). In particular, the developers
  cannot guarantee that the code is bug-free, and users should sign up
  to the mailing list to ensure that they are informed as soon as bugs
  are identified and fixed.

* Except in very specific cases (e.g. automatic grids in
  :class:`~hyperion.model.AnalyticalYSOModel`), the user is fully
  responsible for choosing a grid resolution that is adequate to
  resolve the density and temperature structure - there is no
  automatic re-gridding in Hyperion at this stage.

* Hyperion does *not* choose photon numbers automatically - the user
  is responsible for choosing sensible values. Using too few photons
  may lead to incorrect results.
