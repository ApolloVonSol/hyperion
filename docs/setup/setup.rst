Setting up models
-----------------

The easiest way to set up models via the Hyperion Python library. The following pages give instructions on setting up various types of models:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   model.rst
   analytical_yso_model.rst

Finally, it is possible to write model input files yourself directly in HDF5
and bypass the Python library entirely (but this is reserved for advanced
users!). For this, you can refer to the file format specification:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   ../advanced/model_input.rst
