Setting up models
-----------------

Models are set up via Python scripts via the ``hyperion`` Python library. The following pages give instructions on setting up various types of models:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   model.rst
   analytical_yso_model.rst

The following pages give instructions on controlling the SED/Image and physical array output.:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   conf_images.rst
   conf_physics.rst

Finally, it is possible to write model input files yourself directly in HDF5. For this, you can refer to the file format specification:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   model_input.rst
